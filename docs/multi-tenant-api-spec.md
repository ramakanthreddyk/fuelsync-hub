# FuelSync Multi-Tenant API Specification

## Overview

The FuelSync API is designed with a multi-tenant architecture where:
- **Super Admins** have system-wide access
- **Owners** can manage multiple stations and their employees
- **Employees** are tied to specific stations through the user_stations junction table

## Authentication & Authorization

### User Roles

```typescript
type UserRole = 'superadmin' | 'owner' | 'employee';
```

### Role-Based Access Control

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| `superadmin` | Full system access, can manage all users and stations |
| `owner` | Can manage own stations and employees within those stations |
| `employee` | Can only access data for assigned station |

## Core Entities

### User
```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string | null;
  email: string;
  phone: string | null;
  password: string;
  role: 'superadmin' | 'owner' | 'employee';
  is_active: boolean;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
  stations: Station[]; // Related stations through ownership or user_stations
}
```

### Station
```typescript
interface Station {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  brand: 'IOCL' | 'BPCL' | 'HPCL';
  address: string | null;
  owner_id: number; // References users.id where role = 'owner'
  current_plan_id: number | null;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

### UserStation (Junction Table)
```typescript
interface UserStation {
  user_id: number;
  station_id: number;
  created_at: string;
}
```

### Plan
```typescript
interface Plan {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  price_monthly: number | null;
  max_pumps: number | null;
  max_nozzles: number | null;
  max_employees: number | null;
  max_ocr_monthly: number | null;
  allow_manual_entry: boolean;
  edit_fuel_type: boolean;
  export_reports: boolean;
  features: Record<string, any>;
  is_active: boolean;
  created_at: string;
}
```

## Database Schema Changes

### Key Updates:
1. **Removed `station_id` from users table** - Users are now linked to stations through the `user_stations` junction table or ownership
2. **Added `user_stations` junction table** - Enables many-to-many relationships between users and stations
3. **Owners manage stations** - Owners are linked to stations via `owner_id` in the stations table
4. **Employees can access multiple stations** - Through the `user_stations` table

### Data Access Patterns:

#### For Owners:
```sql
-- Get stations owned by a user
SELECT * FROM stations WHERE owner_id = :user_id;
```

#### For Employees:
```sql
-- Get stations accessible to an employee
SELECT s.* FROM stations s
JOIN user_stations us ON s.id = us.station_id
WHERE us.user_id = :user_id;
```

#### For Super Admins:
```sql
-- Get all stations
SELECT * FROM stations;
```

## Business Rules

1. **Owner Creation**: When creating an owner, optionally create their first station simultaneously
2. **Employee Assignment**: Employees can be assigned to multiple stations through user_stations table
3. **Station Ownership**: Each station has exactly one owner, but owners can have multiple stations
4. **Plan Limits**: Stations are subject to plan limits (max pumps, employees, OCR readings, etc.)
5. **Data Isolation**: Complete data isolation between different owners' stations
6. **Access Control**: Users can only access data for stations they own or are assigned to

## Example Workflows

### 1. Super Admin Creates Owner with First Station

```bash
POST /api/v1/admin/users/owner-with-station
{
  "user": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "secure123"
  },
  "station": {
    "name": "John's Fuel Station",
    "brand": "IOCL",
    "address": "123 Main St",
    "plan_id": 2
  }
}
```

### 2. Owner Adds Additional Station

```bash
POST /api/v1/stations
{
  "name": "John's Second Station",
  "brand": "BPCL", 
  "address": "456 Second St",
  "plan_id": 2
}
```

### 3. Owner Creates and Assigns Employee

```bash
# Create employee
POST /api/v1/admin/users
{
  "name": "Jane Employee",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "role": "employee",
  "password": "password123"
}

# Assign to station
POST /api/v1/stations/1/employees
{
  "user_id": 5
}
```

### 4. Employee Records OCR Reading

```bash
POST /api/v1/ocr-readings
{
  "nozzle_id": 1,
  "source": "manual",
  "reading_date": "2024-01-01",
  "reading_time": "08:00:00",
  "cumulative_vol": 1234.56
}
```

## Migration Notes

### From Previous Schema:
1. **station_id removed from users table** - Relationship now managed through user_stations
2. **Data migration required** - Existing employee-station relationships need to be moved to user_stations table
3. **API updates** - Responses now include stations array instead of single station_id
4. **Authentication flow** - Login now returns user with associated stations array

### Database Migration Steps:
```sql
-- 1. Create user_stations table
CREATE TABLE user_stations (
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  station_id INTEGER REFERENCES stations(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, station_id)
);

-- 2. Migrate existing data (if any station_id exists in users)
INSERT INTO user_stations (user_id, station_id)
SELECT id, station_id FROM users 
WHERE station_id IS NOT NULL AND role = 'employee';

-- 3. Remove station_id column from users
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN station_id;
```

This updated architecture provides better flexibility for multi-station management while maintaining clear data isolation and access controls.
